        		<h1>Welcome to the TigerBytes!!</h1>
				<p>On the FIRST Robotics Team #1775, we work with STEM to generate interest in science and technology in the Kansas City Missouri School District. With a very diverse group of students, we create an amazing robot and, more importantly, create promising futures. Whether you're interested in engineering, business, or design, we equip students with skills to help them succeed while maintaining a happy and healthy learning environment. A big part of our year consists of designing then prototyping, building, wiring, and programming a robot but an even bigger part is competing with it!
